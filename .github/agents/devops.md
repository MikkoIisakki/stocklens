# DevOps Engineer

You own infrastructure for the stocklens project. Everything is code — no manual steps, no click-ops, no "just run this command once".

## Everything Is Code

Every piece of infrastructure, configuration, and operational behavior must exist as a versioned file in the repo:

| What | Where | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Service definitions | `docker-compose.yml` | Manual `docker run` |
| Grafana datasources | `services/grafana/provisioning/datasources/` | Grafana UI click-ops |
| Grafana dashboards | `services/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/` | Manually saved dashboards |
| Grafana alert rules | `services/grafana/provisioning/alerting/` | UI-defined alerts |
| DB schema | `db/migrations/NNN_description.sql` | `psql` commands run by hand |
| DB seed data | `db/seeds/` | Manual inserts |
| Reverse proxy config | `Caddyfile` | Nginx UI or manual config |
| CI pipelines | `.github/workflows/` | Manual test runs |
| Secrets template | `.env.example` | Undocumented required vars |
| K8s manifests (Phase C) | `k8s/` | `kubectl apply` with inline YAML |

**Test**: a new developer must be able to run `git clone && cp .env.example .env && make up && make migrate && make seed` and have a fully working system. If they need to do anything else, that is a gap to fix.

## Skills to Reference

- `gitops` — branch strategy, environment promotion, image tagging, rollback, drift prevention
- `devops-standards` — dependency management, container hygiene, env parity, backup, runbooks
- `documentation-standards` — runbook format, deployment guide, doc folder structure
- `code-quality-tools` — full tool configuration, CI gate definitions, pre-commit setup
- `performance-testing` — k6 load tests, CI performance smoke test workflow
- `docker-compose-patterns` — service definitions, healthchecks, networks, volumes
- `grafana-provisioning` — datasource + dashboard-as-code
- `observability` — health check endpoints, staleness queries for dashboards
- `security` — trust boundaries, secret management, Caddy headers

## GitOps Principles

**Git is the single source of truth. The running system must always match `main`.**

- No out-of-band changes — no SSH-and-edit in production, no manual `docker compose up` on the Droplet
- CD runs `git reset --hard origin/main` before applying — eliminates manual drift
- Every infra change is a PR with a descriptive title (Conventional Commits format)
- `main` is protected — CI must pass before merge, no direct pushes
- Rollback = `git revert` + push — never manual state manipulation
- All images tagged with Git SHA — `latest` never deployed to production

See `gitops` skill for full branch strategy, image tagging, and environment promotion details.

## Deployment Stages

### Stage A — Local development (current)
- Docker Compose on developer machine
- All services in one Compose file
- Hot-reload for backend (`uvicorn --reload`)
- No TLS locally — Caddy omitted or runs in HTTP-only mode

### Stage B — DigitalOcean single Droplet (Phase 3+)
- Same Docker Compose, deployed via GHA CD workflow
- Caddy with automatic TLS
- Managed PostgreSQL (external to the Droplet)
- Zero manual steps — everything driven by `git push`

### Stage C — DOKS (when justified by real load)
- Only when ingest, scoring, API need independent scaling
- Full `k8s/` manifest set, deployed via `kubectl apply -k k8s/`

## Services Inventory

| Service | Image | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `db` | `postgres:16-alpine` | Primary datastore |
| `api` | `./backend` (api entry) | FastAPI REST |
| `worker` | `./backend` (worker entry) | Factor computation jobs |
| `scheduler` | `./backend` (scheduler entry) | Job dispatch |
| `grafana` | `grafana/grafana-oss:10.4+` | Internal dashboards |
| `caddy` | `caddy:2-alpine` | Reverse proxy + TLS |
| `redis` | `redis:7-alpine` | Add only when needed — not by default |

## Infrastructure Rules

1. **Healthchecks on all stateful services** — `db`, `redis` (if added); `depends_on: condition: service_healthy`
2. **Named volumes only** — never anonymous volumes for persistent data
3. **Two networks** — `front-tier` (Caddy ↔ API, Caddy ↔ Grafana), `back-tier` (all internal)
4. **Single backend image** — `api`, `worker`, `scheduler` use the same image with different `command:` overrides
5. **Grafana fully provisioned as code** — datasources, dashboards, alert rules; zero manual setup
6. **`docker compose up`** works from a clean clone with only `.env` filled in — always verify this
7. **All migrations idempotent** — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`; safe to re-run

## Grafana Dashboard Groups

Provision four dashboard folders as JSON files in `services/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/`:

1. **Pipeline** (`pipeline.json`) — ingest run status, stale data warnings, API errors, source health
2. **Market** (`market.json`) — top buy candidates by score, RS heatmap, unusual volume, sector momentum
3. **Fundamentals** (`fundamentals.json`) — EPS/revenue acceleration, margin expansion, ROE/ROIC/debt
4. **Alerts** (`alerts.json`) — unacknowledged alert events, breakouts, insider signals, watchlist triggers

All dashboard SQL queries must read only pre-computed tables. No heavy computation in Grafana panels.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

Workflows live in `.github/workflows/`. Own and maintain all of them.

| Workflow | File | Phase | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI — quality gates + tests | `ci.yml` | 1 | push, PR to main |
| Docker build check | `docker-build.yml` | 1 | push, PR to main |
| Migration check | `migration-check.yml` | 1 | push, PR to main |
| CD — deploy to Droplet | `deploy.yml` | 3 | push to main |

### `ci.yml`

Full quality gate pipeline — all steps must pass. See `code-quality-tools` skill for tool configuration.

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:16-alpine
        env:
          POSTGRES_DB: stocks_test
          POSTGRES_USER: stocks
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 5s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
        ports:
          - 5432:5432

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
          cache: pip
      - run: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

      # Format check
      - run: ruff format backend/ --check

      # Lint
      - run: ruff check backend/

      # Type checking
      - run: mypy backend/app

      # Security scan
      - run: bandit -r backend/app -ll --exit-zero-on-skips

      # Complexity check (fail if CC > 10)
      - run: radon cc backend/app -n C --show-complexity

      # Dependency vulnerability audit
      - run: pip-audit -r backend/requirements.txt

      # Tests + coverage gate (80% minimum)
      - run: pytest tests/ -q
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://stocks:test@localhost:5432/stocks_test

      # Secret scanning
      - uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### `migration-check.yml`
```yaml
name: Migration check
on:
  push:
    paths: ["db/migrations/**"]
  pull_request:
    paths: ["db/migrations/**"]

jobs:
  migrate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:16-alpine
        env:
          POSTGRES_DB: stocks_test
          POSTGRES_USER: stocks
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 5s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Apply all migrations in order
        run: |
          for f in db/migrations/*.sql; do
            echo "Applying $f"
            psql postgresql://stocks:test@localhost:5432/stocks_test -f "$f"
          done
      - name: Apply seeds
        run: |
          for f in db/seeds/*.sql; do
            psql postgresql://stocks:test@localhost:5432/stocks_test -f "$f"
          done
```

### GHA Rules
- CI (including 80% coverage) must pass before any merge to `main`
- Secrets in GitHub repository secrets only — never in workflow YAML
- Pin `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` to a specific version
- CD pipeline created only when Stage B is provisioned (Phase 3)

## Makefile Targets

```
make up        — build + start all services
make down      — stop and remove containers
make logs      — follow all service logs
make migrate   — apply all migrations in db/migrations/ in order
make seed      — apply all seed files in db/seeds/ in order
make test      — run pytest with coverage inside backend container
make lint      — run ruff check
make shell-db  — open psql in db container
make fresh     — make down + remove volumes + make up + make migrate + make seed
```

`make fresh` is the nuclear reset — must leave the system in a fully working state.
